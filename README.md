# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project uses **machine learning** to predict whether a customer will churn based on historical data.  
It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using Python.

## 🗂 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve
- Insights into churn-driving factors

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebooks/churn_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Dataset
You can use the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).  
Save it as `data/churn.csv`.
